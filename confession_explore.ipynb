As far as I know, people in foreign services in China demonstrate a high level of understanding in their target nation's history, language and political atmospheres. And here we have these clowns cracking jokes in their politics classes. What a shame.\",\n",
       " \"796. I'm aware of the large community of Chinese nationals here, and would like to point out that there's a difference between the Chinese People (who deserve respect & protection from xenophobic BS as all persons do) and the Chinese Government. The latter should recieve as much criticism as all governmsnts do, but defending it blindly out of nationalism also legitimizes its less-than friendly policies towards its citizens and neighbors and is very much hurtful to those of us who are affected by them.\",\n",
       " '795. The coronavirus is such a man-made disaster. Let\\'s not forget how the Chinese gov\\'t spent the crucial first one-and-a-half month of the epidemic outbreak to cover up for the outbreak and arrest people who talked about it online for \"spreading rumors\". For anyone interested, here\\'s a twitter thread that sums up some of the reported cases of arrest (https://twitter.com/SpeechFreedomCN/status/1222402584167665664)',\n",
       " \"794. that feel when you feel as though you are constantly anxious and suffering but can't divulge any inner thoughts of being upset to your few friends because they too have problems that they don't deal with well and you don't want to burden anyone or make it about yourself and caps is a piece of shit who won't return your calls and you alternate between 4 and 14 hours of sleep staying up hopelessly throwing out confessions on a cringe confessions page as if that would change anything, anyone else know that feel\",\n",

       " '792. It is funny to see how ignorant people joke about the Chinese government and Chinese people. They usually fail to come up with any meaningful or sophisticated reasonings. Their opinions are mostly those severely biased ones brought up by Western media.\\nI doubt if they know anything about China, Chinese history, Chinese culture, or Chinese politics. They probably only care about the fact that belittling the Chinese can boost their low self-esteem.\\nWhat a bunch of pitiful losers!',\n",
       " \"791. I finally cut somebody unhealthy out of my life, and I didn't realize how bad they were for me until they were gone. Now I'm just kicking myself for not cutting them out sooner, I wasted a lot of time on them.\",\n",
       " '789. lmao with the kind of absolutely disgusting things people eat, coronavirus is to be expected. Good job people, others with healthy eating habits r suffering cuz of u\\n790. Every few years, there is a panic over a disease originating from a foreign country. By the severity of these diseases, the panic is extremely disproportionate. In 2003, SARS resulted in 27 infections and 0 deaths in America. In 2005, avian flu resulted in 0 infections and 0 deaths in America. In 2014, Ebola resulted in 11 infections and 2 deaths in America. In 2016, Zika virus resulted in 4830 infections and 1 death. Currently, the mortality rate of coronavirus is estimated to be 2% (estimated 6000 cases worldwide),… More',\n",
