Have you considered how toxic of a mindset it is to think \"everyone except for me is fake/unaccepting\"? Maybe you\\'re the one who is unaccepting. Everyone has their own insecurities and complexities. Also, people don\\'t come to CMU with dating as their main goal. Relationships are hard enough without the academic pressure of CMU.

On Saturday there was a shooting going on at home (it\\'s not even physically near where my family is from, but it\\'s still \"where I\\'m from\" in a general sense). And I spent the entire day in denial going \"don\\'t think about it. just focus on your homework that\\'s due tonight. don\\'t talk to your friends about it because it will make their days depressing.\" I frantically checked twitter the entire day about it.

I\\'ve noticed that many asian students, particularly East Asian, dont seem to be very keen on making friends of other races, which is why I think its easy to be sinophobic, especially when many people think they are being cold towards them. However, I think that when you go to a whole new country, you inevitably flock to familiar faces to give yourself a sense of security. Also, a lot of friendship is built on good conversations and banter, and how much can you talk to someone who never understands your jokes and does the same awkward laugh for everything you say? The gap is neither the American kids\\' fault or the Asian\\'s.
